        My name is <b>Jayden Patel</b>, and I am a high school student at <b>ASMSA</b> (the Arkansas School for Mathematics, Science, and the Arts)
        that loves playing video games, hanging out with friends, and working on projects for computer science.
        I hold a student leader position of <b>Community Leader</b>, which means I am in charge of my dorm floor and help them with any problems
        they may have as well as plan events for them. I'm also co-president of the <b>Computer Science Club</b>, which is a club that meets weekly
        to discuss computer science topics and attend competitions.
